# week8FantasyCoin
Welcome to fantasy coin. The aim of this application is to allow users to practice trading in cryptocurrencies at exact exchange rates. We aimed to use express and handlebars. Unfortunately due to public holidays and illnesses the project has not been completed. The most developed part of the app is the back-end. This was developed without a functioning front-end.

In the back-end, not all routes are complete. The functioning routes are: "/", "/signup", "/profile/:user", "/trading", "/logout", "/login", "/newUser". Due to the lack of front end, these will have to be accessed through GET & POST requests using tools such as [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/).
